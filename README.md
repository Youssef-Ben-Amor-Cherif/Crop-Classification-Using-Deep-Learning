# Crop-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on developing a robust image classification model to identify 5 types of agricultural crops: wheat, rice, sugarcane, corn, and jute. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the model is trained on a dataset of augmented images to achieve high accuracy in crop classification tasks.
